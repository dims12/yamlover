# CHAPTER — the `chapter` / `chunk` document model

A **chapter** is yamlover's document node: a readable page with an optional heading and a body of
content. It is the schema the web viewer renders as an article (README §chapter renderer). This
spec defines its shape; companion specs: `META.md` (the schema vocabulary), `TYPES.md` (the type
lattice), `YAMLOVER.md` (the surface), `MARKLOWER.md` (the inline markup a prose chunk is written
in), `TICKETS.md` (`task`, which extends chapter).

## The model — an omni node with a positional body

> A chapter is **just an omni (`variant`) node** (TYPES.md): optional keyed **`title`** and
> **`description`**, and everything else is an **unkeyed (positional) body element**. Each body
> element is *either* a **nested chapter** (the recursion) *or* a **chunk** (a renderable content
> block). There is one interleaved body stream, read top to bottom — no `chunks` array and no
> `children` array.

This is the whole design. Prose, media, diagrams, and subchapters are **siblings in one ordered
sequence**, the way a real document reads. A chapter with only prose is a flat article; a chapter
with subchapters is a tree.

**Position is the author's.** The renderer shows every element — `title`, `description`, chunks,
and subchapter links — **in source order**, wherever the author placed it: the heading is not
hoisted to the top, subchapters are not forced to the end, and base-level prose may follow a
subchapter. The **TOC** likewise lists subchapters in **body order** — even when each subchapter is
its own subdirectory (a directory chapter, `examples/66-pet-keeper-handbook`), whose alphabetical
directory scan is overridden by the positional `*` body pointers that place them. A subdirectory
present on disk but never referenced by a body pointer sorts **after** the ordered ones, in
directory-scan order.

```yamlover
# a whole article in one tagged .yamlover file
!!<*yamlover/$defs/chapter>
title: Getting Started
description: the shortest tour            # optional
- yamlover is a YAML layer over the filesystem.   # a chunk (marklower prose by default)
- !!<format: text/x-latex> |              # a chunk that overrides its (type, format)
  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
- *: diagram.png                          # a chunk that is a pointer to a file
- title: A subchapter                     # a nested chapter (a body element with a title)
  - its own body chunk, and so on…        # recursion
```

- **`title` / `description`** are keyed and optional (`text/marklower`). They are the heading.
- **A chunk** (`$defs/chunk`) is one renderable value; its `(type, format)` selects the renderer,
  defaulting to `text/marklower` prose (`MARKLOWER.md`). Override per chunk with an inline tag (`!!<format: …>`) or a file
  pointer (`*: pic.png`, whose format comes from the extension). A chunk may be a `string` or a
  `binary` (an image/pdf/… pointer).
- **A subchapter** is a body element that is itself a chapter — recognized **structurally**: a
  *container* (it has keyed and/or positional entries) renders as a subchapter; a *leaf* (a scalar
  or a file pointer) renders as a chunk.
- **A table** (`MARKLOWER.md`) is a body element explicitly tagged `!!<*yamlover: $defs: table>` — a
  container, so the tag (not shape) is what keeps it from being a subchapter.

## The schema

`$defs/chapter` is a normal yamlover/meta schema (META.md):

```yamlover
type: variant                     # omni: keyed fields AND a positional body at once
properties:
  title:       { type: string, format: text/marklower }
  description: { type: string, format: text/marklower }
items:                            # the body — a positional sequence
  anyOf:
    - *:: yamlover: $defs: chapter   # a subchapter (a container) — the recursion
    - *:: yamlover: $defs: table     # a table (MARKLOWER.md) — enters only by its explicit tag
    - *:: yamlover: $defs: chunk     # a content block (a leaf)
```

The body element type is a **union** (`items: {anyOf: […]}`) — the first construct of its kind in
the taxonomy. The engine's schema propagation (walk.ts) routes each body element to the matching
branch by shape (container → chapter, leaf → chunk) and stamps its `(type, format)`, so a chapter
tagged only at its root makes every nested subchapter `x-yamlover-chapter` and every prose chunk
`text/marklower` — no per-node tag needed. A **table** (`$defs/table`, MARKLOWER.md) does not take part
in the shape routing — both a subchapter and a table are containers — so it enters the body only by
its **explicit tag** (`!!<*yamlover: $defs: table>`), which wins over the structural default; an
untagged container stays a subchapter.

`$defs/chunk`:

```yamlover
type: [string, binary]            # prose, or an image/pdf/… pointer
format: text/marklower            # the default; overridden per chunk
```

## Attaching a chapter

Two ways, both in `META.md`:

- **Inline tag** (a `.yamlover` file or an inline value): `!!<*yamlover/$defs/chapter>` on the node.
  A whole article fits in one file (`examples/60-simple-chapter.yamlover`).
- **Directory overlay**: a directory's `.yamlover/body.yamlover` is tagged at its root, so the
  *directory itself* is the chapter and its files can be referenced as pointer chunks
  (`examples/68-math-chapter`, `65-all-formats-chunks`). Subchapters can themselves be
  **subdirectories** — each its own directory chapter, referenced by a `*`-pointer body element —
  giving a recursive tree where every chapter is a directory (`examples/66-pet-keeper-handbook`:
  `dogs/`, `cats/`, `fish/`, and nested `dogs/puppies/`).

## Addressing body elements

A chapter node at path `P` addresses its **body elements by their store index** on the node itself:
`P[i]` (the omni model indexes keyless entries by their absolute position — `title`/`description`,
being keyed, consume indices too, so a titled chapter's first body element is `P[1]`). A
document-relative marklower link therefore points at `:[i]` (`MARKLOWER.md`; the legacy slash
spelling `/[i]` still parses — see `69-marklower-links.yamlover`), and a subchapter's chunk at
`:[i][j]`.

The web editor's surgical edits (`/api/edit`, README §editor) use **the same absolute index** — an
edit path is a plain yamlover path, nothing else. (It once addressed a body element by its *rank*
among the positional items, a second index space in which `title` counted for nothing; the two
disagreed about which `[i]` a subchapter was.) See `tools/server` `engine-api.ts`.

## `task` extends `chapter`

`$defs/task` (TICKETS.md) is declared as an **extension** of chapter — `allOf: [*chapter]` — so it
inherits `title`/`description` and the omni body, adds keyed planning fields (`priority`, `due`,
`assignee`, `estimate`, `depends`), and **narrows** the body recursion to subtasks with its own
`items: {anyOf: [*task, *chunk]}`. Because `task ⊆ chapter`, the intersection collapses to
`task | chunk` — a subtask, not a subchapter.

## Status

The positional-body model **replaces** the earlier `title`/`description`/`chunks`/`children`
encoding (a chapter used to keep chunks and subchapters in two separate keyed arrays). Migrated
across schemas, engine, the web renderer/editor, examples, and tests.
